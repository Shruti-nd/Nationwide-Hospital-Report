## 🏥 Hospital Nationwide Analysis Report

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of hospitals across the United States using **SQL** for data management and **Tableau** for visualization. It explores various dimensions of hospital performance, services, and geographic distribution to deliver actionable insights for healthcare decision-making.

### 📊 Project Objectives

* **Analyze hospital services and infrastructure** including emergency service availability, ownership type, and hospital classification.
* **Evaluate hospital quality metrics** such as mortality, safety of care, and timeliness compared to national averages.
* **Visualize geographic coverage** using location data (state, city, zip, and coordinates).
* **Identify top-rated hospitals** and areas lacking adequate emergency coverage.
* **Create interactive dashboards** to help stakeholders explore hospital performance and accessibility.

### 🗄️ Datasets & Tables Used

1. **`gen_hosp`** – General hospital info (ID, name, latitude, longitude)
2. **`location`** – State, city, zip code, country for each hospital
3. **`hosp_details`** – Hospital type, ownership, rating, and emergency service availability
4. **`hosp_quality`** – Quality comparisons (mortality, safety, timeliness) with national averages
